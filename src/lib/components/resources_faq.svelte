                  We facilitate power-from-waste projects by matching businesses with the right technology providers. Our goal
                  is to turn non-recyclable waste into low-cost, green power, and we offer a range of technologies such as
                  anaerobic digestion units, pyrolysis, gasification and AD slurry covers.

                <div class="text-md leading-[26px] font-light font-PublicSans w-full">
                  Power-from-waste refers to the process of generating electricity or heat by treating waste materials. These
                  processes aim to divert waste from landfills while creating a sustainable energy source.

                  We can facilitate solutions for a broad spectrum of non-recyclable waste materials including industrial waste,
                  organic waste, and much more. However, it's worth noting that we are unable to work with e-waste, sand, glass,
                  or ceramics.

                  Our advanced calculator tool is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of your project's
                  scope. By inputting various parameters such as the type and volume of waste, and your energy needs, the tool
                  estimates crucial variables. These include the scale of the project, potential savings, and expected returns
                  on investment (ROI). This helps you to quickly gauge the feasibility and profitability of a power-from-waste
                  solution.

                  Costs can vary widely depending on factors such as the technology used and the scale of the project.
                  Typically, there's an initial cost for a feasibility study, which includes lab analysis of the waste material
                  to determine its suitability for power generation. Other costs include planning & permissions, equipment,
                  installation, and operational expenses.

                  complex installations like pyrolysis or gasification plants, the timeline may extend to 12-24 months. This
                  includes the time needed for feasibility studies, procurement, construction, and commissioning of the
