              Recent headlines have focused on the UK's new net zero strategy, announced on March 30th. While the plan
              highlights the need to transition away from fossil fuels, it falls short in terms of providing a comprehensive
              approach to sustainability. Instead, it invests heavily in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, which some
              experts argue has yet to prove its large-scale effectiveness.

                Our planet's ecosystem is suffering from the consequences of a financial system that prioritises profit above
                all else. With no voice or political influence, nature bears the brunt of this unprovoked war. As shareholders
                of planet Earth, the power to change lies within us, but how do we make an impact.
