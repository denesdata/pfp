              In recent news, Lufthansa released a poster reading "Protecting the Planet", featuring a plane overlaid on an
              image of the Earth, which was rapidly banned in the UK for misleading consumers about the airline's environmental
              impact. While Lufthansa has set a goal to become carbon neutral by 2050 and has invested in sustainable aviation
              fuel and carbon offset programs, there are currently no environmental initiatives or commercially viable
              technologies in the aviation industry which would substantiate the green claim "protecting the future".

                A recent investigation has revealed troubling news about forest carbon offsets. The world's leading certifier,
                Verra, relied upon by major corporations like Disney, Shell, Gucci have been approving offset projects that are
                largely ineffective at combating climate change.

              <div class="text-sm leading-[25px] font-light font-PublicSans w-full">
                The investigation analysed a significant percentage of Verra's projects and found that over 90% of the
                rainforest offset credits - which are among the most commonly used by companies - are likely to be "phantom
                credits". These credits do not represent genuine carbon reductions, which means that the purported benefits of
                these offsets are largely worthless.

              Meanwhile, the South Korean government has said it will start taking action against companies that make misleading
              sustainability claims. It is a first-of-its-kind move in Asia and other governments and regulatory bodies should
              take note and follow suit.

              Under a draft new law, companies that mislead the public about their environmental impact will face fines of up to
              KRW3 million (£1,920). The news comes four months after the country’s largest oil and gas company SK E&C was
              forced to modify a marketing campaign that claimed the firm would produce “CO2-free” liquefied natural gas at a
              planned plant in northern Australia.

              The environmental harm caused by humans has led to a rapid acceleration of natural changes in my climate system.
              Of course, as a planet, I will still be here for quite some time - around 7.5 billion years, give or take a
              millennium. But unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the multitude of life forms, particularly the human
              species. Climate extremes will soon become the norm and coping with them will be a tremendous challenge.

              However, if humanity chooses to prioritise environmental repair over damage, there is a chance we can mitigate the
              worst effects of climate change. It will require more than just PR stunts and lip service. Real, substantive
              action is what's necessary - action that shows a genuine concern for the environment and a willingness to do what
              it takes to preserve our planet for future generations.

              We are no longer falling for flashy ad campaigns and PR-led trickery. We are wise to the tactics that corporations
              use to distract from their harmful actions. We are keeping a close eye on the leaders who perpetuate this cycle of
              deception, and they will be held accountable for their actions. In fact, the charge for corporate manslaughter is
              not out of the question - what about charges for the countless lives affected on earth?

              You have the power to make a real difference. Instead of spending millions of dollars on PR campaigns that only
              serve to create the impression that you care about the environment, why not put your resources to work on projects
              that actually remove CO2 from the atmosphere? You could take non-recyclable waste and turn it into green energy,
              providing a secure supply of energy while also enhancing the environment. Your brand could be the one that
              sponsors this initiative. The time for action is now - let us make a difference before it's too late.
